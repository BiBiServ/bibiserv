PLEASE NOTE: This is the ReadMe-file for the test-package of BiBiServs Visualizer-package.
To use the test-files of this package in your IDE, please generate a test-folder in your
project-folder and copy all of the files in this <default package> into it.

If the tests of this package work just fine without using the advice above, you do not
have to do that.



For testing some Visualizers (e.g. RAEDA or RNAMovies) you need a sample BiBiServ-Config-File
to create spool-directories, which are used to store test-data temporarily.
To adjust the spool-directory please open the bibiserv_properties.xml-file and change the
<entry key="spooldir.base">/tmp/viewertest/result</entry>-tag.

Normally, you do not have to change that.
